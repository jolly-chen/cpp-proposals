questions:
- deprecate octal constants starting with a leading zero at the same time as introducing this proposal?
- modify also octal escape sequences in character constants as proposed in the addendum?
- allow binary escape sequences in character constants (for coherency)?
- prescribe the behaviour of compilers in case the value of a character literal falls outside the implementation-defined range defined for char. 
- synchronise standardization with C standard?
- propose a change of the C-run time library function strol?

<a name="Proposal"></a><h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>Proposal to add <tt>0o</tt> and <tt>0O</tt> as an alternative (and preferred) sequence to introduce octal-literals.
</p>
<p>
The syntax rule to interpret integer literals starting with a zero as 
octal-literals probably dates back from the time people were still 
tinkering with 8 or 16 bit processors in their garages.
This syntax rule is what might be called an “historical mistake”.
Nowadays, this feature is hardly used and can be easily misunderstood or
 overseen by novice programmers leading to unexpected errors.
</p>
<p>
To allow future generations (of developers if not compilers) to correct this feature,
I propose to add the character sequence <tt>0o</tt> as an alternative
(and preferred) sequence to introduce an octal-literal.
The prefix <tt>0o</tt> follows the model set by the prefix <tt>0x</tt> to introduce a hex-literal, and (since c++14) <tt>0b</tt> to introduce a binary-literal.
</p>

<p>
From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal</a>) :
<i>
"Newer languages have been abandoning the prefix 0, as decimal numbers  
are often represented with leading zeroes.
The prefix q was introduced to avoid the prefix o being mistaken for a 
zero,
while the prefix 0o was introduced to avoid starting a numerical literal
 with an alphabetic character (like o or q),
since these might cause the literal to be confused with a variable name.
The prefix 0o also follows the model set by the prefix 0x used for 
hexadecimal literals in the C language;
it is supported by Haskell,[11] OCaml,[12] Perl 6,[13] Python as of 
version 3.0,[14] Ruby,[15] Tcl as of version 9,[16] and it is intended 
to be supported by ECMAScript 6[17] (the prefix 0 has been discouraged 
in ECMAScript 3 and dropped in ECMAScript 5[18])."
</i>
</p>


<a name="Examples"></a><h2>Examples</h2>
<pre><code>
// The following literals all specify the same number.

int literal_octal_prefered          = 0o52;
int literal_octal_to_be_deprecated  = 052;
int literal_decimal                 = 42;
int literal_hex                     = 0x2A;
int literal_binary                  = 0b00101010;
</code>
</pre>

<a name="Effects on existing code"></a><h2>Effects on existing code</h2>
<p>
This proposal does not invalidate the existing syntax rule for integer literals starting with a zero.
Also, under the current standard, any sequence starting with 0o is illegal.
As a consequence, the proposed modification will not break existing code.
</p>

<a name="Discussion"></a><h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>
The objective of this proposal is to create the possibility, by adding this more coherent syntax to introduce octal-literals,
to deprecate and phase out the current octal literal syntax in a future version (if so decided).
</p>

<p>
It is recommended that at the places where the 0o sequence is introduced
 in the documentation, explicit attention is drawn to the existence of 
an incoherent (but backward compatible) syntax of integer literals 
starting with a zero.
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that a similar 'clean-up' is required in the specification of the 
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fscanf.html"><tt>scanf</tt></a> and
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/strtol.html"><tt>strtol</tt></a> families of C run-time library functions.
The required modifications, although outside the scope of the C++ language, are also detailed below.

<p>
1 An <i>integer literal</i> is a sequence of digits that has no period or exponent part, with optional separating single
quotes that are ignored when determining its value. An integer literal may have a prefix that specifies its base
and a suffix that specifies its type. The lexically first digit of the sequence of digits is the most significant.
A <i>binary</i> integer literal (base two) begins with <tt>0b</tt> or <tt>0B</tt> and consists of a sequence of binary digits.
An <i>octal</i> integer literal (base eight) begins <ins>with <tt>0o</tt>, <tt>0O</tt> or </ins>with the digit <tt>0</tt> and consists of a sequence of octal digits.<sup>22</sup>
A <i>decimal</i> integer literal (base ten) begins with a digit other than <tt>0</tt> and consists of a sequence of decimal digits.
A <i>hexadecimal</i> integer literal (base sixteen) begins with <tt>0x</tt> or <tt>0X</tt> and consists of a sequence of hexadecimal
digits, which include the decimal digits and the letters a through f and A through F with decimal values ten through fifteen.
[ <i>Example:</i> The number twelve can be written 12, <ins>0o14, </ins>014, 0XC, or 0b1100. The literals
1048576, 1’048’576, 0X100000, 0x10’0000, and <ins>0o</ins>0’004’000’000 all have the same value. — <i>end example</i> ]

<a name="Addendum"></a><h2>Addendum</h2>
<p>
While browsing the standard for the keyword 'octal', a second occurrence
 of octal encoded information was spotted in escape sequences of 
Character literals.
The following modification could be considered in addition to the 
modification of octal-literals discussed above.
</p>
<p>
Note that the proposed modification hereunder also removes the 
restriction that limits the number of octal digits in an escape sequence
 to <tt>3</tt>,
as there is no such restriction for hexadecimal escape sequences.
Of course, the specification that <i>'the value of a character literal 
is implementation-defined if it falls outside of the 
implementation-defined range defined for char ...'</i> is itself ill 
defined.
Better would be to specify explicitly that the compiler produces a 
warning/error and/or to prescribe that the value equals the specified 
value modulus the implementation-defined range for char.

<a name="fscan strol"></a><h2>Technical Specification C run time library functions: strol, scanf</h2>
Although related, but outside the scope of the C++ language, proposed 
modifications to the technical specification of the C run time library 
functions <tt>strol</tt> and <tt>scanf</tt> are given here for completeness:
<h3><a name="strol">strol</a></h3>
<p>
Make the following edits (relative to
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/strtol.html">pubs.opengroup.org:strtol</a>)
with <ins>insertions</ins> and <del>removals</del> marked like so:
</p>
<p>
If the value of base is <tt>0</tt>, the expected form of the subject sequence is that of a decimal constant, <ins>binary constant</ins>, octal constant, or hexadecimal constant,
any of which may be preceded by a <tt>'+'</tt> or <tt>'-'</tt> sign.
A decimal constant <ins>[<i>deprecated:</i></ins> begins with a non-zero digit, and<ins>- <i> end deprecated</i>]</ins> consists of a sequence of decimal digits.
<ins>A binary constant consists of the prefix <tt>0b</tt> or <tt>0B</tt> followed by a sequence of the digits <tt>'0'</tt> or <tt>'1'</tt> only.</ins>
An octal constant consists of <ins>the prefix <tt>0o</tt> or <tt>0O</tt> [<i>deprecated:</i> or</ins> the prefix <tt>'0'</tt>, optionally<ins>- <i>end deprecated]</i></ins> followed by a sequence of the digits <tt>'0'</tt> to <tt>'7'</tt> only.
A hexadecimal constant consists of the prefix <tt>0x</tt> or <tt>0X</tt> followed by a sequence of the decimal digits and letters <tt>'a'</tt> (or <tt>'A'</tt> ) to <tt>'f'</tt> (or <tt>'F'</tt> ) with values 10 to 15 respectively.
</p>
<p>
If the value of base is between 2 and 36, the expected form of the 
subject sequence is a sequence of letters and digits representing an 
integer with the radix specified by base,
optionally preceded by a <tt>'+'</tt> or <tt>'-'</tt> sign.
The letters from <tt>'0a'</tt> (or <tt>'A'</tt> ) to <tt>'z'</tt> (or <tt>'Z'</tt> ) inclusive are ascribed the values 10 to 35;
only letters whose ascribed values are less than that of base are permitted.
If the value of base is <ins>2, 8,</ins> 16,
the characters <ins><tt>0b</tt> or <tt>0B</tt>, <tt>0o</tt> or <tt>0O</tt>,</ins> <tt>0x</tt> or <tt>0X</tt> <ins>respectively</ins>
may optionally precede the sequence of letters and digits, following the sign if present.
</p>
<h3><a name="scanf">scanf</a></h3>
As the technical specification of <tt>scanf</tt> (
<a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/scanf.html">pubs.opengroup.org:scanf</a>)
is based on the specification of <tt>strol</tt>, no modification is required to this specification.
In practice, the documentation of <tt>scanf</tt> (in e.g. man pages) is often implicitly expressing the behaviour of the underlying <tt>strol</tt> function.
This documentation should be adapted accordingly. Example:

<pre><code>
conversions
i   Matches an optionally signed integer; the next pointer must be a pointer to int.
    The integer is read:
      in base 16 if it begins with <tt>0x</tt> or <tt>0X</tt>,
      in base 8 if it begins with 0<ins><tt>o</tt> or <tt>0O</tt> [<i>deprecated:</i> or 0 - <i>end deprecated</i>]</ins>,
      <ins>in base 2 if it begins with <tt>0b</tt> or <tt>0B</tt></ins>
      and in base 10 otherwise.
    Only characters that correspond to the base are used.
